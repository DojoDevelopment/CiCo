- billing does not display correctly throughout app
- no upload picture function
- midnight bug can not complete clock out after midnight (Sql for last login)
- No first business, location, or supervisor
- empty space in select dropdowns edit employee might be specific to my database the way enum was converted to text


Alvaro sql is all working, though billing does not display correctly due to age function
it returns different objects depending on time

billing.days
billing.hours
billing.minutes
billing.seconds

it's accurate but we need to program for it now, or find another time subtraction function to use
I should be in by lunch.
